[I'm on Github](https://github.com/taxigy/) since April 2012. However, I began being really active no earlier than three years later, in 2015. I don't have any remarkable repositories yet. Just a bunch of simple ones.

## Conway's Game of Life
This one is a command line interpretation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) built for [Node](http://nodejs.org). I'm a big fan of algorithms and Javascript, so this repo has born at the intersection of the two.

## Yeoman generators
There are two simple generators, one [for Angular projects](https://github.com/taxigy/generator-angular-stub) and one [for Meteor projects](https://github.com/taxigy/generator-meteor-stub). The latter helps generate a stub Meteor project and set up environment in a single CLI command.

## Liquid Template for iTunes Feed
This one consists of a single file that can be used as a template for any page within Jekyll project. Simply applying it to any page and putting certain properties into a post leads to automatic RSS feed generation. It is then completely valid in terms of [iTunes requirements](http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html).
