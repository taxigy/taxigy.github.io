Becoming a new person or a new professional means not only getting through difficulties but also being assessed. Or, at least, self-assessed.

So, I decided to become a full-stack web developer. It may sound funny because previous eight years of my career consist of mostly managerial roles, duties and actions. I'm not a guy who submerges into IDE for hours to produce somethings; I'm of those guys who speaks a lot and hangs around with business folks to strike a hard bargain of budget increase or moving a deadline.

One may think, 'The hell, man? Why are you even thinking about changing your current management job to coding one? Why so downshifting?'. And it may sound true. However, details matter.

I'm a humble guy. Talking with business partners, closing the deals, negotiating on prices and bargaining on man-hours is what pushes me way out of my comfort zone. I've undergone such conditions for eight years in a row, and now I have that feeling inside that tells me I can do more. Being a manager means doing less and obtaining more; switching to coding means doing more and obtaining less. Being a mix of both is challenging, so I accept it.

One may think, 'But you are too old for that stuff!'. I agree, it's weird to reset career when you're approaching your 30s. It would be without any prior experience. My luck, I have some. At least my diploma and everything that happened to me to get it.

So, what are goals I set myself to attain FSWD badge? Simple:

1. Understand how the environment that the back-end is being run on works.
2. Get into tooling. Grunt, Gulp, npm and all that stuff.
3. Understand how precompilers are used within certain tools.
4. Learn popular server-side languages.
  * JavaScript and Node.js
  * Python and Django
  * Ruby on Rails, much as I dislike it
4. Get used to useful frameworks that are built on top of server-side engines.
  * Node â€” Hapi, Sails, Express
5. Learn responsive web design basic concepts, details and nuances. Learn popular RWD CSS libraries.
6. Learn widely used front-end frameworks and libraries. Understand them, dive into code.
  * Angular 1.3 and, soon, 1.4
  * React
1. Time for mobile.
  * Cordova vs React Native

_I'm going to modify this post as I learn new things, so the list is not complete yet, as well as my understanding of who a full-stack web developer is._
