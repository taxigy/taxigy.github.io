The idea that a human will be able to program everything in the world around first came to me when I was fourteen, few years after I encountered a PC for the first time. It was a quite old computer at my friend's, and we used to play video games, some sorts of small platformers or long-story quests.

My first impulse was — guess what — to ask parents to buy me a computer. I didn't know what I needed it for. It was not a feeling that some adult middle-class worker has when their colleague appears at morning at the office with a new iPhone, preferably "s" or "plus". It was a feeling like I knew I'd do something amazing with it, along with occasionally playing some "500 best games for IBM PC, issue 6" stuff. But I just didn't know what in particular.

Well, I asked. I still remember how I made a pitch for the first time in my life. Before that, I'd barely cared. If I'd asked something and they wouldn't have given it, it wasn't a huge problem. A PC was. So I pulled myself together and applied all my wits to compose the first compelling speech. It worked.

## We're going to have more apps, and this won't stop nor decline soon

The next thing I remember mostly clearly is my feeling that, soon enough, there won't be anything a human won't be able to do with the help of a computer. Or, to be precise with that human, won't be *willing* to do. I'm not talking about office employees who are not willing to calculate taxes and approve credit applications without passingly checking into Facebook. I'm talking about people who, for centuries, worked solely with their hands and backs, and what's happening nowadays is just a bare disruption of their approach. I'd say the progress collides with these people's reluctance and resistance but it's out of scope.

Data and information, computer vision, artificial neural networks. Robots are everywhere. A plane, run by a solar power, without a single drop of hydrocarbons, flies overseas for 117 hours and a distance of 7,200 kilometers. Aerial vehicles without pilots fly around since 1980s. Tesla Motors cars, claimed to become driverless on several years.

So, I basically agree with a short and modern claim: *there's an app for that.* Or will appear shortly, if the problem needs to be solved.

## The apps won't be developed but rather composed

Fast forward many years, I have been walking over an amazing career, which practically may be considered as one gone not so far from the beginning, and I do all things information, applied computer science, and enterprise software. But several years ago I started noticing a very special something in the wind.

I couldn't come up with a certain words until a friend of mine, [Yaroslav](http://yalozhkin.com) told these words. He said that, nowadays, it's still great if one develops software but, from business perspective, time-to-market matters and there are so many ready-to-use components that can be easily integrated that it'd not sufficient to be just a developer anymore. One should be able to compose a solution or, if not possible, what resembles it closest, and only then continue with building something new on top of it to get to the destination point.

The thought itself doesn't sound revolutionary. But if you take a look at newly appearing online applications and services, you'll see the difference. Today, a service functionality is considered insufficient unless

* it integrates with a lot of other stuff, so you can pipe the data around across multiple ones, and
* it provides an API.

Just think about what apps you stick to most, and I believe you'll confirm.

It may not seem right, like one may reject an idea that what they need is a bunch of multitools to compose every single tool they want. But in software world, this method seems to work and not quite surely beaten by any other approach or concept.

## Apps need physical representation to become even more helpful

I once scrolled over 9gag and saw a picture of a Samsung Note smartphone attached to a long handle so the result was a form of a shovel. Well, the idea is true, but how it was expressed isn't.

The apps need some physical things to work on top of to be useful. People need food, so a straightforward solution to this problem would be to extend agricultural equipment with some sort of algorithmic thinking and automation so humans would be busy with things with a little higher intellectual load. Or, maybe, less intellectual; just ask people around how they spend their (thankful to machines and automation all around) free time and you'll probably discover their most appreciated casual video games or social networking services.

Engineering of physical things is tough and expensive (opposed to apps, however arguable in certain cases). As soon as we face a crisis, it won't seem as tough. We're heading backwards and will meet few quite old ones, like global shortage of food or, what you've fed up with breaking news about, climate change.

But we'll still need apps, of course. And those still will be able to be composed rather than developed from scratch. And it's amazing.

## So, what's the conclusion?

The whole model "find a problem, make an app, boom! problem solved" is too simplistic. Humanity has proved to love simplifications over complex things (except, maybe, ancient Chinese philosophers), and this thing hardly changes. So I believe there's a lot behind that I just cannot see. But in general, and for deterministic problems it's applicable. And, for example, growing a field of wheat is a quite deterministic problem.

So, applying a simple model, one could claim that almost everything can be reduced to an app. Not entirely everything, of course, but considerable majority of problems.

## A piece of advice (for my younger self)

I don't think big often. This is not bad. And I certainly wouldn't give an advice to anyone to think big, rather than to think *bigger.* Just a level or two higher than normal would be fine. It's safe for one's brain and it's precisely what other big-thinking-people around expect.

For years, I have been building enterprise software. If I cut all the shuck out, there will remain hardly more that 1/4 of this time when the problems, decisions and solutions were big. But it has happened, and I'm happy with it (although, 4 times less happy than I could be). So be you.
