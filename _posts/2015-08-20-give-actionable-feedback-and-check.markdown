People are good at receiving feedback if it is given in a proper way. One way to do is to give actionable feedback. It means a person who receives it should, after the exchange is over, be clear and confident about what are next steps to take to implement the new knowledge.

But one who has given the information has to check back later to make sure things were done correctly. 

So, the idea is simple, and the recipe consists of few steps:

1. Pack feedback into an actionable list.
2. Go through the list to make sure the person who receives feedback understands each step correctly.
3. Wish them good luck.
4. Start observing and checking subtly.

You, like a parent of a toddler, should not lead nor hold a hand. You also should not be somewhere at a distance. But you have to be both, holding dualistic pattern, and adapt in a single moment when things change. This lay at the core of subtleness.

It's tough. People have their own preferences and their very own approaches. But in most cases, people just hate to be led or observed directly. You don't want to surround yourself with hateful people, do you? With patience and constant tuning, though, this technique gives extraordinary results.
