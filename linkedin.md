You can easily [find me on LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rishatmuhametshin). However, if you'd like a **tl;dr** version, here it goes.

I've been around software development since 2007, in the roles of product owner, customer advocate and business analyst. My core domain expertise is delivery and logistics, and transportation industry. More than half of my career, I've worked on software that enables transport, taxi and delivery services do their job better.

My passion is education, and it's pleasure to see the effort that individuals and groups put into the new education opportunities nowadays. I spend bulk of my time working with young professionals. It's fulfilling to help them gain knowledge and experience, see big picture and focus on right things. From time to time, I teach things related to Computer Science as a lecturer at local university.

I'm [more of PI and less of AE](http://www.adizes.com/management_styles/), so I prefer investing into building and training teams rather than leading them, and choose research and discovery over flow control.

From time to time, I pick a topic that I feel is interesting and novel for me, and learn. The most recent one is functional programming (pretty hot one), thus major FP languages, Clojure and Haskell among them.
