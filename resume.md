## Profile

Having 8 years total experience in software development, I've covered different software product development stages and set up processes that helped organizations step up new product delivery to successfully conquer new business fields. The skill set I demonstrate is T-shaped and includes broad project management experience as well as deep knowledge of software development technologies.

I am passionate about setting up processes that help scale product delivery and communications among different teams and streams.

## Experience

### Senior Software Engineer, Svyaznoy; Izhevsk (remote office), Russia — 2014-present

In 2014 the company decided to open a remote office in Izhevsk and asked me to be a part of the local software development team and represent the office as an interim administrator of branch. After the office had been constructed and launched, I'm mostly responsible for front-end development and system analysis. It's also my task, although secondary, to architect APIs and communicate with other teams of engineers that provide or consume APIs among dozens of company's products.

As an interim branch manager, I'm in charge of recruiting and running local HR processes. To the moment, I've built the team of engineers from 3 to 9 professionals, and now the process is frozen sine die.


### Software Development Analyst, Directum; Izhevsk, Russia — 2012-2014

During the whole term, I was primarily in charge for a single product which is called 'Directum Solo' and is a mobile application for the users of vendor's core product, Directum. With the product team, we completed four consecutive projects with total budget of over 110,00 man-hours, created several MVPs and shipped 6 public versions, each having huge dependencies on other products or certain clients. Here, I've acted both as a product manager and architectural engineer. I hadn't been involved in actual engineering (some people call it 'coding') much.

I also have had a secondary role, an engineer at R&D department. The research team of four engineers and two analysts has put on trial several new concepts on a monthly basis (keeping fast pace), each finalized by an MVP that confirmed or disproved initial market or product idea. My main responsibility was front-end development and analysis of hypotheses performed on mined data or unstructured information collected abroad.


### Head of Product Development, Bitmaster; Izhevsk, Russia — 2011-2012

With newly created structure within the organization, I've acted as a project manager for the projects that have involved third-parties; and have been responsible for in-house API design and implementation. With a small team, we have finished three projects (from about 1000 to 10,000 man-hours) and shipped new products that support core business and provide additional marketing tools for the organization.


### Technical Writer, engineering generalist, Bitmaster; Izhevsk, Russia — 2007-2012

As a part of engineering team, I accomplished the complete redesign and migration of user manuals and technical documentation and put the information management process in order. Primarily, I acted as a front-end engineer at the whole version development cycle, from scope definition to transferring the version into support; as a generalist, I also performed the named support, both for customers and in-house stakeholders.
