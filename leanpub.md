[I'm on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/u/rishatmuhametshin) and I write books. Well, not actually. I write long stories that then inevitably will compile into books. Some stories are posted here, some [on Medium](/medium/), and some elsewhere. The core idea around them is that the book is like waterfall, and stories that one day will compose a book is like agile. And I love being agile.

Right now, I only have a single book in progress, and it's in Russian. But I already have some great ideas and people around them to put them into words, then publications, then books, all iteratively.
